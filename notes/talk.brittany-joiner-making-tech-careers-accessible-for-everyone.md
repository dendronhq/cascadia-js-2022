## Abstract

If you didn't 'grow up' coding or study comp sci at uni, you might have never considered a technical job. Yet it's totally possible for people midway through their non-technical career to become a developer. But why aren't more people doing it? I go through my journey from marketer to developer and explain the things that helped and hindered me. You'll learn why more folks don't do it and specific things we can all do to change that!

## Notes

![[talk.brittany-joiner-making-tech-careers-accessible-for-everyone.*]]

- used to be a marketer, now a programmer!!
- Story of journey
- Common Roadblocks/perspectives
	- "Girls aren't into coding", ask them if their interested
	- Not seeing people like you.
	- limited view of what engineering is.  Much more broad then just writing code
	- Sexism is still a thing
	- Bootcamps are still not very accessible, expensive, very intense multi-month commitments.  Consider altcademy
	- "Just start coding and google when you get stuck", isn't helpful advice or encouragement.  Be specific, be willing to do it together, get to know the person, how they learn.
	- learning on the side is very difficult.  Esp. when you are working a FT job to make a living.
	- Lack of supportive company/job environment.
		- companies need to invest if having non-tech folks who are interested teck.  Better than hiring out
- Action Items
	- Look for mentor opps
	- find "under-represented" people OUTSIDE of tech! 
		- find people from non-technical back grounds.... they provide great perspective.  **Hire them over tech people and tech them the tech**
	- expand a definition of engineer
	- Intro people to more light tech things
	- **Show mistakes!**
	- Don't be a tech bro
	- Tell your story!
