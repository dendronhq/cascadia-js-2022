- Problem 1: The situation of Services in 2022
  - Allow users to authenticated using Auth Service
  - Sharing data across services (like from a photo service to music service) requires downloaing the data and re-sharing.
- Problem 2: Too much in the way
  - Browser
  - REST
  - Server
  - Data Store
  - DEvOps
- Problem 3: Toxic Data
  - 2005: Credit Card info in DB
  - 2015: Personal Info in DB
  - 2025: Nothing in DB
- Suggestion 1: Networked Data, not apps.
- Suggestion 2: Open Protocols
  - HTTP has been open
  - What if we get open protocols for
    - Auth (interop without pre-negotiation)
    - Data (ubiquitous dumb storage)
    - Compute (local and remote lambdas)
- Three techniques
  - Content Addressing
  - Private Data Substrate
  - Fault-safe concurrency
