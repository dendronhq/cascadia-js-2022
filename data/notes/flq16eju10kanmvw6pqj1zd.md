- many people don't have a linear path from compsci undergrad to software career
- meet underrepresented groups where they are
    - most of these groups are in caretaking roles
- "fresh perspectives" means from another company or industry, but different roles creates cognitive diversity
- roadblocks
    - exposure is an issue/blocker, technical stuff provided to boys more often than girls - ask them if they care
    - not seeing people in the role is a blocker
    - be loud about who you are (if you feel comfortable/safe doing so)
    - limited view of engineering, what it is, lots of types of roles that don't involve writing code all day
- hiring managers - think outside the toolbox, screen for other skills and teach technical stuff later
- don't be sexist or comment on people's ability based on how they look, gender, etc
- most bootcamps are still inaccessible
    - altcademy - promotes more low cost courses and bootcmaps
    - (personal note: I usually recommend odin project because it's 100% free https://www.theodinproject.com/ and the various roadmaps for guidance https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
- "just start coding and google when you get stuck"
    - this is bad advice
- hard to work all day then code in the evening
- lacking supportive company/job environment
    - not everyone can transition within the company
    - Zapier and Adidas actively work to develop their employees, split time roles to eventually switch to a more technical role
- getting stuck and feeling like you're the only person that gets stuck
- create slack channel called "learn-to-code" and share resources, help people understand tech is more than building apps
- if you got to tech on the traditional path, show your mistakes and don't be a tech evangelist(?)
- if you're from the non-traditional path
