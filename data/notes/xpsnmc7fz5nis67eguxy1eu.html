<ul>
<li>used to be a marketer, now a programmer!!</li>
<li>Story of journey</li>
<li>Common Roadblocks/perspectives
<ul>
<li>"Girls aren't into coding", ask them if their interested</li>
<li>Not seeing people like you.</li>
<li>limited view of what engineering is.  Much more broad then just writing code</li>
<li>Sexism is still a thing</li>
<li>Bootcamps are still not very accessible, expensive, very intense multi-month commitments.  Consider altcademy</li>
<li>"Just start coding and google when you get stuck", isn't helpful advice or encouragement.  Be specific, be willing to do it together, get to know the person, how they learn.</li>
<li>learning on the side is very difficult.  Esp. when you are working a FT job to make a living.</li>
<li>Lack of supportive company/job environment.
<ul>
<li>companies need to invest if having non-tech folks who are interested teck.  Better than hiring out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Action Items
<ul>
<li>Look for mentor opps</li>
<li>find "under-represented" people OUTSIDE of tech! 
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>expand a definition of engineer</li>
<li>Intro people to more light tech things</li>
<li><strong>Show mistakes!</strong></li>
