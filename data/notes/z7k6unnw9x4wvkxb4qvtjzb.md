- data in the browser, lots of variations
- backend 
  - aws 
  - sql vs nosql
  - relational vs non-relationsnal

- relational & acid
  - atomicity
  - consistensity
  - integrity
  - data partition
- limitation is scalability

- nosql
  - great for scale
  - unstructured
  - partionable

- base
  - basically available
  - soft state 
  - eventual consistency

- new sql
  - sql & nosql
  - eg. aurora, fauna

- what to use
  - it depends
  - bank deposit: sql
  - upvotes: nosql

- why not both?
  - data infrastructure > database

- takeaways
  - tribalism is bad
  - integrity good
  - data > databases
