<ul>
<li>many people don't have a linear path from compsci undergrad to software career</li>
<li>meet underrepresented groups where they are
<ul>
<li>most of these groups are in caretaking roles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"fresh perspectives" means from another company or industry, but different roles creates cognitive diversity</li>
<li>roadblocks
<ul>
<li>exposure is an issue/blocker, technical stuff provided to boys more often than girls - ask them if they care</li>
<li>not seeing people in the role is a blocker</li>
<li>be loud about who you are (if you feel comfortable/safe doing so)</li>
<li>limited view of engineering, what it is, lots of types of roles that don't involve writing code all day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hiring managers - think outside the toolbox, screen for other skills and teach technical stuff later</li>
<li>don't be sexist or comment on people's ability based on how they look, gender, etc</li>
<li>most bootcamps are still inaccessible
<ul>
<li>altcademy - promotes more low cost courses and bootcmaps</li>
<li>(personal note: I usually recommend odin project because it's 100% free <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">https://www.theodinproject.com/</a> and the various roadmaps for guidance <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap">https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"just start coding and google when you get stuck"
<ul>
<li>this is bad advice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hard to work all day then code in the evening</li>
<li>lacking supportive company/job environment
<ul>
<li>not everyone can transition within the company</li>
<li>Zapier and Adidas actively work to develop their employees, split time roles to eventually switch to a more technical role</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>getting stuck and feeling like you're the only person that gets stuck</li>
<li>create slack channel called "learn-to-code" and share resources, help people understand tech is more than building apps</li>
<li>if you got to tech on the traditional path, show your mistakes and don't be a tech evangelist(?)</li>
<li>if you're from the non-traditional path</li>
</ul>
