- used to be a marketer, now a programmer!!
- Story of journey
- Common Roadblocks/perspectives
	- "Girls aren't into coding", ask them if their interested
	- Not seeing people like you.
	- limited view of what engineering is.  Much more broad then just writing code
	- Sexism is still a thing
	- Bootcamps are still not very accessible, expensive, very intense multi-month commitments.  Consider altcademy
	- "Just start coding and google when you get stuck", isn't helpful advice or encouragement.  Be specific, be willing to do it together, get to know the person, how they learn.
	- learning on the side is very difficult.  Esp. when you are working a FT job to make a living.
	- Lack of supportive company/job environment.
		- companies need to invest if having non-tech folks who are interested teck.  Better than hiring out
- Action Items
	- Look for mentor opps
	- find "under-represented" people OUTSIDE of tech! 
		- find people from non-technical back grounds.... they provide great perspective.  **Hire them over tech people and tech them the tech**
	- expand a definition of engineer
	- Intro people to more light tech things
	- **Show mistakes!**
	- Don't be a tech bro
	- Tell your story!
