- reverse engineering apis
- eg:
  - ordering extra bacon
	- custom frontends (for couchsurfing)
- disclaimer: be ethical when reverse engineering
- demo: tik tok api
	- view api request
	- see session details (HAR file, import into postman)
	- capture stream 
	- replay
	- scrape dynamic websites
		- header as googlebot
- hyrum law: anything that is an api will be consumed
